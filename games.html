                </p>
                <p> Deus Ex: &ldquo;Mankind Divided: Sometimes it has a big impact, like life or death, or sometimes it&apos;s just in the little details, like you might not realize right away, but a character might comment on how you perform, or you&apos;ll read an email that&apos;s customized to what you did in the game. It&apos;s very cool, it&apos;s empowering as a player to have agency &rdquo;

                <p> Disco Elysium - The Final Cut: &ldquo;Disco Elysium - The Final Cut expands its original cast to include fully voiced performances for every character, but none make more of an impact than the 24 different sections of your brain that accompany you throughout your journey. To emphasize just how important they are, roughly half of the more than one million words spoken in this sprawling RPG belong to your character&apos;s innermost thoughts. Voicing all two dozen of these cerebral incarnations is jazz musician Lenval Brown, who masterfully breathes new life into ZA/UM&apos;s tome of a script. &rdquo;

		        <p> The top 3 Racing (Car Racing) games of the year!! </p> 
                <p> Forza Horizon 5: &ldquo;I&apos;ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that&apos;s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can&apos;t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn&apos;t just upped the ante once again; it&apos;s blown the bloody doors off. &ndash; Luke Reilly, September 25, 2018 &rdquo;

                </p>
                <p> F1 2021: &ldquo;The cutscenes are well done, particularly considering they&apos;re really unlike anything Codemasters&apos; F1 team have attempted before, and there&apos;s a decent authenticity to the performances overall. &rdquo;

                </p>
                <p> Hot Wheels Unleashed: &ldquo;Hot Wheels Unleashed&apos;s racing experience is as arcade as it comes&ndash;you only need to concern yourself with accelerating, drifting, and boosting. Admittedly, early races are a torrid affair until you settle into your favored vehicle and learn how to take corners; drifting requires incredibly early commitment unless you like pinballing off the walls. &rdquo;

                <p> Metroid Dread: &ldquo;With a shorter length, even later stages can remain fresh in players&apos; minds, allowing them to tackle repeat playthroughs with a growing sense of prowess and efficiency. Anyone who&apos;s replayed a favorite game multiple times will tell you about the feeling of looking back at your initial time playing the game; breezing past sections that once had you scratching your head, taking down bosses in a fraction of the time it used to take you. &rdquo;

                </p> 
                <p> Hitman 3: &ldquo;All six of Hitman 3&apos;s beautiful and strikingly well-lit levels are amongst the strongest of the series, so much so that it&apos;s hard to pick a standout favourite. &rdquo;

                </p>
                <p> It Takes 2: &ldquo;It Takes Two is like a box of donuts in your office breakroom: it arrives fresh, is gleefully devoured, and absolutely nothing included in it stays long enough to grow stale.&rdquo;
