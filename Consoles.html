                        <p class="text"> Consoles are today&apos;s way to escape stress (and reality)&#44; though its developed much more than before. Consoles are the most budget friendly option for the daily gamers&#44; who just want a break from life. Nowadays&#44; its very hard to imagine the roots&#44; that consoles emerged from. Now under the protection of glass&#44; in the computer museum of America&#44; sits the Magnavox Odyssey, often referred to&#44; as the grandfather of the $40 Billion gaming industry. The Magnavox Odyssey wasn’t a big success as many expected&#44; if not&#44; it was a failure in the industry. But this laid the groundwork for the most prominent game of them all&#44; Pong. Pong later went on to help devs make another renowned piece of history&#44; the first Nintendo Game Boy!

                    <p class="text"> Today&apos;s next gen consoles are the Xbox Series X, and the PlayStation5. I personally stick with Microsoft, since my old game library will be able to run on the new Xbox through cross platform tech (a way to run old disc games on a newer console with improved graphics). It also seems the Xbox series X has better hardware, (though I won’t get into the nitty gritty topics involved) and runs better out of the box than the PlayStation 5. But everything is completely up to personal preference.

                    <p class="text"> You may be wondering, what&apos;s the difference between a console and a gaming pc. Well to put it into the simplest terms, a console often operates with an Operating System and CPU that differs from that of a laptop or Desktop (Windows 10 and Mac OS are examples of Operating systems [OS]) provided by the manufacturer and is geared specifically towards the Hardware of the console. They are often identical to desktop pcs. But the hardware on consoles is designed solely for the purpose of gaming, whereas desktops can be used for multiple different utilities like word processing.
