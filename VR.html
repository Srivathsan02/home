                    Virtual Reality, or VR for short, is a way to create a simulated environment which can be viewed in all angles (360 degrees). To use this technology, we often need to own a Virtual Reality headset, which can be purchased from brands such as  Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR,  HTC Vive, Google Daydream View, or Google Cardboard. Then we usually use our whole body, or joysticks provided with the headset, to navigate this new world!.

                VR has been around for 2 decades now, but after being told time and time again that it was the future, VR has proved time and time again that it hasn&apos;t developed enough to really be part of our day to day lives. There are many factors involved in the &ldquo;why VR hasn&apos;t been implemented much&rdquo;, mainly considering the cost. To purchase a  &ldquo;reputable&rdquo; entry level VR headset, you could be looking at anywhere between 400 &#8208; 500 dollars, which is a pretty large sum in general; but to add salt to the burn, this VR headset you just purchased isn&apos;t even the best on the market. It&apos; an entry level model, to buy a powerful model, you would need to spend about 1,000 dollars or more!

                <p class="text"> Using VR also requires a bit of tech knowledge and lots of time to setup your new system, which many people don&apos;t have enough of. Thereby ensuring people without too much time, and people without tech knowledge can no longer use this device to its full capacity. We also need to consider the simple fact that VR doesn&apos;t have much support! We have a countable number of good games to enjoy, and many companies find it too much work to rewrite code for this platform due to the lack of players. We also must consider that many of these headsets are heavy when on your face (since they pack a LOT of hardware) and also need tons of wires and sensors to use. In the end, this doesn&apos;t really seem like futuristic gaming, just a new design put out by Facebook to please a restless audience back in 2012.

                <p> All hope isn&apos;t lost however, as the industry is growing at a fast pace with projections showing the rise of the industry to more than 12 billion dollars in the US by 2024. What does this mean for the Future of VR? Well, what this means is as there is a growing audience, more money will be invested into development, meaning better quality and better price to performance ratios. This also means more game developers will think about creating games specific to this platform, increasing its demand even further. And as company investments start paying themselves, the prices of this gear will become reasonable. Overall, this would mean that a VR centered (gaming) future will be upon us soon.
